The Primary Care Plan (PCP) is a healthcare plan that aims to provide eligible workers with accessible and affordable healthcare. The PCP covers a wide range of health services, including medical treatment, health screenings, and vaccinations, for foreign workers in Singapore. Here are some details about the PCP for migrant workers:

**1. Mandatory for certain migrant workers:** Employers are required to purchase a PCP as part of work pass requirements for Work Permit and S Pass holders.

**2. Coverage and benefits:** The PCP is designed to cover most of the migrant workers' primary care needs, including medical treatment, health screenings, and vaccinations. Under the PCP, migrant workers are entitled to one statutory medical examination for work permit application or renewal, which includes a medical consultation, physical and clinical examination, chest x-ray, and blood tests. Additionally, one annual basic health screening is provided, which includes a physical examination and a mental health assessment.

**3. Cost and co-payment:** The annual cost of the PCP for migrant workers is between $108 and $138, depending on the sector they live in. Migrant workers covered under the PCP co-pay a fixed medical treatment fee of $5 for each visit at any MOM medical centre, or $2 for each telemedicine session. For workers not covered under the PCP, the amount to be co-paid can be mutually agreed via the employment contract or collective agreement and is capped by law at 1% of the MWsâ€™ fixed monthly salary for each outpatient visit, or $5, whichever is higher.

**4. Accessibility of care:** In addition to 24/7 telemedicine services available via the FWMOMCare App, each zone consists of one Medical Centre for Migrant Workers (MCMW), Designated GP clinics, and On-site Medical Centres in stipulated large dormitories (where applicable) to ensure accessibility of care for the workers.
