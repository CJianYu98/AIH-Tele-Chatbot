An employee can only claim medical leave wages for days that employee is normally working.

If the employee is given medical leave, they are entitled to full average monthly earnings (AME) for up to 14 days of outpatient medical leave and 60 days of hospitalization leave. If the employee is on light duties due to the work injury, they are entitled to the shortfall between their actual wages and the AME for the first 15 days. For subsequent days of medical leave or light duties, the employee is entitled to two-thirds of their salary within one year starting on the date of the accident that caused the work injury.
